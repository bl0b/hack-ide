My Go Things
============

In this project I focus on trying to express some properties of a given position that are typically used by a go player to evaluate the situation, in terms of score, local strength, global balance, and so on.
I aim at providing a static analysis, not based on statistical outcomes (as it is with the monte-carlo evaluation performed in most of the move generators).
